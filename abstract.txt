Abstract

In today's world, families are becoming increasingly nuclear, leading to a weakening of extended family connections. Kinnected is an innovative web-based platform designed to bridge this gap by enabling users to build and explore their family trees. The application allows users to create personal profiles, add relatives by sending connection requests, and build a dynamic, visually represented family network.

The core functionality of Kinnected revolves around merging family trees at common nodes, allowing users to discover and connect with relatives through an intuitive search system. Users can customize connection cards, store private notes about their contacts, and manage privacy settings for shared information. The application ensures secure connections by requiring mutual acceptance of connection requests before any information is shared.

From a technical standpoint, Kinnected utilizes a structured database with multiple tables, maintaining individual and shared user data. The system is designed for scalability and privacy, ensuring that users have control over the visibility of their information. Security measures, including authentication and access control, are implemented to protect user data.
